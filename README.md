## Overview
Micro-Donation Platform is a web application that enables users to make small, impactful donations to support various causes such as education, healthcare, and environmental initiatives. The platform connects donors, causes, and rewards in an innovative way, promoting transparency, engagement, and social impact.

## Features

### 1. User Registration and Authentication
- **User Roles:**
  - **Donor:** Individuals who browse causes and make donations.
  - **Recipient:** Organizations or individuals creating causes and receiving donations.
  - **Admin:** Oversees the platform, manages causes, donations, and rewards.
- **Secure user authentication** using email and password.
- **Role-Based Access:** Different roles have tailored access to features.

### 2. Cause Management
- Causes represent initiatives requiring funding (e.g., "Save the Rainforest").
- Each cause includes:
  - A title and description.
  - A funding goal (target amount).
  - A progress tracker showing funds raised.
- Causes can be created, viewed, and updated by recipients or admins.

### 3. Donation System
- Users (donors) can donate small amounts to support a cause.
- Donations include:
  - Amount donated.
  - A message of support (optional).
  - Timestamp indicating when the donation was made.
- Donors can track their donation history and impact.
- Causes display a list of all donations, fostering transparency.

### 4. Rewards System
- Donors earn reward points for contributions.
- Points can be redeemed for tangible rewards (e.g., certificates, merchandise).
- Admins manage the rewards catalog and set redemption criteria.
- The **UserReward** system tracks redeemed rewards for each user.

### 5. Impact Visualization
- A dashboard displays:
  - Total funds raised per cause.
  - Number of donors per cause.
  - Progress bars for funding goals.
- Users see their personal impact in terms of supported causes and contributions.
